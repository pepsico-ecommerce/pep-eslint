# eslint-plugin-pep-imports

Custom Pepso ESLint rules and definitions

## Installation

You'll first need to install this plugin:

```sh
npm i github:pepsico-ecommerce/pep-eslint#x.x.x
```

Next, install all of the peerDependencies (this is because `pep-eslint` contains ESLint rules
from other modules, and the only way to install them are via peerDependencies)

```sh
npx install-peerdeps --dev github:pepsico-ecommerce/pep-eslint
```
